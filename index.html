        Ashenda is a festival celebrated in August in the Ethiopian regions of Tigray and Northern Amhara. In this ceremony there will be great traditional songs sung by girls coming from all over the villages and they will be wearing Ashenda. Ashenda is a Tigrinya word meaning "tall green grass", estimated at around 80â€“90 cm minimum height on top of their traditional dresses which makes the celebration even more colorful. This cultural festivity was originated from two historical legends that occurred in different periods. These were;

        The death of Jehphttah's son by her father as an offer to the god of Israel in the Old Testament and
        The death and reincarnation of Virgin Mary (mother of Jesus) in the New Testament
        The festival of Ashenda has cultural, religious and economic importance

            Fichee-Chambalaalla, New Year festival of the Sidama people
        </h2>

            Fichee-Chambalaalla is a New Year festival celebrated among the Sidama people. According to the oral tradition, Fichee commemorates a Sidama woman who visited her parents and relatives once a year after her marriage, bringing buurisame, a meal prepared from false banana, milk and butter, which was shared with neighbours. Fichee has since become a unifying symbol of the Sidama people. Each year, astrologers determine the correct date for the festival, which is then announced to the clans. Communal events take place throughout the festival, including traditional songs and dances. Every member participates irrespective of age, gender and social status. On the first day, children go from house to house to greet their neighbours, who serve them buurisame. During the festival, clan leaders advise the Sidama people to work hard, respect and support the elders, and abstain from cutting down indigenous trees, begging, indolence, false testimony and theft. The festival therefore enhances equity, good governance, social cohesion, peaceful co-existence and integration among Sidama clans and the diverse ethnic groups in Ethiopia. Parents transmit the tradition to their children orally and through participation in events during the celebration. Women in particular, transfer knowledge and skills associated with hairdressing and preparation of buurisame to their daughters and other girls in their respective villages.

      <h2>Ethiopia's Oromos celebrate Irreechaa thanksgiving festival</h2>
      <img src="/img/irreecha-3.jpg" alt="Irecha1" style="width:600px">
       <p style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma,    sans-serif; word-spacing: 5px;">
       Irrecha, the national Thanksgiving holiday of the Oromo people, is a traditional Ethiopian holiday that is yearly observed by the Oromo people in Hora Harsadi (Lake Harsadi), Bishoftu, and the Oromia Regional State.  On this day, the Oromo people congregate close to and around Lake Hora Harsadi and fervently express gratitude to waaqaa (God) for his blessings and mercies during the previous year as well as for the orderly passage from the dark, difficult winter season to the bright, sunny, fruitful, and productive days of summer (Birraa).  In addition to giving thanks for God's bounties and mercies, the Oromo people pray for even greater mercy and blessing in the next year on Irrecha.                        
       They view the wet winter season, which lasts from June to September, as dark and challenging because of the starvation and food shortages, the flooding of rivers, and the destruction of homes, farms, and livestock during heavy floods.  Families and close relatives were unable to get together as regularly due to the swollen rivers during this season because food from the harvest season in January had already been consumed during the months before; moreover, malaria strikes a large number of locals during these rainy seasons.  
       According to the Gadaa lunar calendar, Irrecha is frequently observed on either the final Sunday in September or the first Sunday of the first week in October each year.  The Oromo populations in Ethiopia and abroad, notably in North America and Europe, joyfully celebrate this cultural event.  As families, close friends, and acquaintances gather at celebration locations while wearing traditional Oromo attire, this yearly Thanksgiving cultural festival strengthens social ties and cultural ties among Oromo people.  Last year's Irrecha event in Bishoftu town near Lake Harsadi drew more than 500,000 visitors.  It has been constantly heard from a number of domestic and international tourism elites.
