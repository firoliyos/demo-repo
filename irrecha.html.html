        Irrecha, the national Thanksgiving holiday of the Oromo people, is a traditional Ethiopian holiday that is yearly observed by the Oromo people in Hora Harsadi (Lake Harsadi), Bishoftu, and the Oromia Regional State.  On this day, the Oromo people congregate close to and around Lake Hora Harsadi and fervently express gratitude to waaqaa (God) for his blessings and mercies during the previous year as well as for the orderly passage from the dark, difficult winter season to the bright, sunny, fruitful, and productive days of summer (Birraa).  In addition to giving thanks for God's bounties and mercies, the Oromo people pray for even greater mercy and blessing in the next year on Irrecha.
               
                  
        They view the wet winter season, which lasts from June to September, as dark and challenging because of the starvation and food shortages, the flooding of rivers, and the destruction of homes, farms, and livestock during heavy floods.  Families and close relatives were unable to get together as regularly due to the swollen rivers during this season because food from the harvest season in January had already been consumed during the months before; moreover, malaria strikes a large number of locals during these rainy seasons. 
     
        According to the Gadaa lunar calendar, Irrecha is frequently observed on either the final Sunday in September or the first Sunday of the first week in October each year.  The Oromo populations in Ethiopia and abroad, notably in North America and Europe, joyfully celebrate this cultural event.  As families, close friends, and acquaintances gather at celebration locations while wearing traditional Oromo attire, this yearly Thanksgiving cultural festival strengthens social ties and cultural ties among Oromo people.  Last year's Irrecha event in Bishoftu town near Lake Harsadi drew more than 500,000 visitors.  It has been constantly heard from a number of domestic and international tourism elites.
