                    <h3 id="axum"><u>Axum And Surrounds</u></h3>
                    <img src="image/image-5.jpg" alt="Axum city" title="Axum city" height="320" width="350" class="img1">
                    <p>
                        The ancient city of Axum is adorned with the tallest obelisk ever erected in the ancient world&lsquo; along with the miscellany of other antiquities&lsquo; ranging 
                        from ruined palaces dingy catacombs and centuries-old churched to inscribed tablets detailing ancient military campaigns into Yemen and Sudan. As the most important 
                        tourist hub in the northerly federal region of Tigray&sbquo; the ancient city is readily accessible by air from Addis Ababa and several other points along the northern
                        historic circuit&lsquo; or a long half-day&lsquo;s driven from Gonder and the Semien Mountains to the southeast and Mekele(capital of Tigray) in the southeast. Axum&lsquo;s 
                        most iconic monument is the field of 120-odd obelisk&sbquo; ranging from small&sbquo; roughly hewn stones to finely engraved obelisks the height of a ten-storey building &sbquo;
                        concentrated within an area of 1&sbquo;000m<sup>2</sup> opposite the cathedral of Maryam Tsion. The site incorporates what are probably the three tallest obelisk ever erected in 
                        ancient times&sbquo;neatly engraved blocks of sold granite that stood between 23<abbr title="meter">m</abbr> and 33<abbr title="meter">m</abbr> high.The obelisks were excavated 
                        at the quarry at <em>Gobo Dura</em>&sbquo; more than 4<abbr title="kilo-meter">km</abbr> to the southwest and were most probably dragged to their present location by domesticated 
                        elephants. There&lsquo;s no entirely satisfactory explanation for how the Axumite engineers erected these massive block of stone-tradition has it that the supernatural power of 
                        the <em>Ark of Covenant</em> were put into play&lsquo; but a more rational explanation would involve pulleys and elephants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Exploring the obelisk park conveys something of the majesty of ancient Axum&lsquo; but it is the tour through the exemplary site museum that illustrates just how cosmopolitan and 
                        technologically advanced the city was. Display includes a collection rock tablets inscribed in several languages including ancient Sabaean. An array of Axumite household artifacts 
                        ranges from a set of drinking glasses imported from Egypt to a collection of Axumite coins minted between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> centuries&lsquo; <abbr title="Anno Domini">
                        AD</abbr> more recent artifact is a 700-year old leather bible&lsquo; written in Geez and decorated with illuminations. Now located directly behind the obelisk park&lsquo; the museum 
                        seems likely to move again in the medium term&lsquo; as important tombs have been located beneath.

                        Other the most fascinating site is Axum Tsion Mariam church which is the first Christian church in sub&#8209;Saharan Africa. It which was constructed during the reign of Ezana, King of Axum
                        &sbquo; in the 4<sup>th</sup> century <abbr title="Anno domini">AD</abbr>. Every year&sbquo; 21 Hidar in the Ethiopian calendar or 30 November or 01 December in a leap year&sbquo;, more than 
                        100&sbquo;000 people come to Axum from all over Ethiopia to commemorate the founding of this church&sbquo; with many pilgrims coming on foot&sbquo;having walked for up to a month. There is a 
                        marvelous atmosphere in the town&sbquo; and great spectacles for the visitor with processions of the clergy and deacons&sbquo; with drumming&lsquo; dancing and chanting.In addition to the 
                        attractions of the festival, and the Church of Mariam Tsion, Axum has a number of fascinating historical monuments. From around 200<abbr title="Before Birth">BC</abbr> to 700 <abbr title="Anno Domini">
                        AD</abbr> Axum was the seat of an Empire which extended across the Red Sea to Arabia&sbquo; traded with India and China&sbquo; minted its own coinage&sbquo; had its own alphabet and notational system&sbquo;
                        constructed great engineering works and dams and which was reckoned by the 3<sup>rd</sup> century Persian historian Mani to be one of the four great powers of the ancient world&sbquo; alongside Persia&sbquo; 
                        China and Rome. Today the visitor can see stelae (the largest single pieces of stone erected anywhere on the world&sbquo; it is still not understood how they were transported from the quarry 4 <abbr 
                        title="Kilo meter">km</abbr> away and erected)&sbquo; the tombs and castles of kings&sbquo; Axum Museum and sites with the ruins of residential houses.
                    <p>
                        On a day trip from Axum&sbquo; we can visit the temple at Yeha&sbquo; Ethiopia&lsquo;s first city&sbquo; settlement in the area dates back more than 2800 years. There are the remains of a temple 
                        dedicated to Ilmuqeh&sbquo; the moon god&sbquo; and next to the temple is the church of Abune Aftse&sbquo; one of the &quot;9 Saints&quot; who did much to spread Christianity in Ethiopia. The 
                        temple at Yeha is the oldest building in sub&#8209;Saharan Africa. We can integrate the festival of Hidar tsion with visits to other places on the Historic Route&sbquo; to the rock hewn churches 
                        of Gheralta&sbquo; to the Afar Region&sbquo; or other parts of the country&sbquo; the Omo valley&sbquo; bird watching&sbquo; trekking and other activities.

                        The fortified historic town of Harar is located in the eastern part of Ethiopia&sbquo; 525 <abbr title="kilo meter">km</abbr> from the capital of Addis Ababa&sbquo; on a plateau with deep gorges surrounded by 
                        deserts and savannah. The walls surrounding this sacred city&sbquo; considered &quot;the fourth holy city&quot; of Islam&sbquo; were built between the 13<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup>th centuries and served 
                        as a protective barrier. There were five historic gates&sbquo; which corresponded to the main roads to the town and also served to divide the city into five neighborhoods&sbquo; but this division is not functional
                        anymore. The Harar gate, from where the main streets lead to the centre&sbquo; is of recent construction. Harar Jugol numbers 82 mosques&sbquo; three of which date from the 10<sup>th</sup> century&sbquo; 102 shrines 
                        and a number of traditional&sbquo; Indian and combined townhouses with unique interior designs&sbquo; which constitute a spectacular part of Harar&lsquo;s cultural heritage. The African and Islamic traditions influenced
                        over a long period of time the development of the city and its typical urban planning and contributed to its particular character and uniqueness. The present urban layout follows the 16<sup>th</sup> century design for 
                        an Islamic town with its central core occupied with commercial and religious buildings and a maze of narrow alleyways with imposing facades. The traditional Harari house has a typical&sbquo; specific and original 
                        architectural form&sbquo; different from the domestic layout usually known in Muslim countries&sbquo; although reminiscent of the coastal Arab architecture&sbquo; and with an exceptional interior design. At the end of 
                        the 19<sup>th</sup> century Indian merchants built new houses with wooden verandas that defined a different urban landscape and influenced the construction of the combined Indian/Harari houses. Their architectural and 
                        ornamental qualities are now part of the Harari cultural heritage. Harar functioned as the capital of the Harari Kingdom from 1520 to 1568&sbquo; became an independent emirate in the 17<sup>th</sup> century and was 
                        integrated into Ethiopia in 1887. From the late 16<sup>th</sup> century to the 19<sup>th</sup> century Harar was an important trade centre between the coast and the interior highlands and a location for Islamic learning.
                        Today Harar is the administrative capital of the Harari People National Regional State. The historic town has a traditionally functioning community&sbquo; forming a complex social-environmental whole where each element 
                        has its symbolic and practical significance. The Harari people are distinguished by the continued cultural traditions and quality of their handicrafts&sbquo; including weaving&sbquo; basket making and book binding. 
                        The organization of the communities through traditional systems has preserved its social and physical inheritance and&sbquo; significantly&sbquo; the Harari language.
